        Don't bother reading the SparkNotes.
        It does sort of make sense to read them after
        reading the book to make sure you
        didn't miss anything, but there are places
        where SparkNotes includes information not
        mentioned in the book or gets things wrong.
        Take their info with a grain of salt.<br>
        My English teacher adds "traps" to each test to find out who
        only reads the SparkNotes.
        For example, in The Great Gatsby, Nick stays
        for the night in a hotel in one chapter.
        Here's what he asked:
    </p>
        <blockquote>
        In Chapter 2, Nick stays for the night in a hotel.<br>
        What hotel did Nick stay in?
        </blockquote>
    <p>
        The hotel's relative location is given, but not
        the name. Most readers won't connect that there
        is a real hotel at the specified location.<br>
        If you only read the SparkNotes, you would answer
        with the name of the hotel. If you read the book,
        you would answer with the relative location.
        If you read both you would include both.<br>
        If in doubt, read the book, not the SparkNotes.
