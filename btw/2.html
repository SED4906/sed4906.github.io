        People tend to take things for granted. A lot of visual cues get missed,
        whenever they're in fine print. I have to wear glasses as my eyesight is
        failing me, but my sight does not; I can tell whether your reply to a
        message on Discord pinged the author or not, but some don't have an eye keen
        enough to notice the difference. There is indeed an obvious one. Just look.
