        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I draw things, and sometimes write code.</p>
        <p>There are some <a href="https://sed4906.itch.io">games I've made.</a> There aren't many right now.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Significance of SED</h3>
        <p>The "SED" part came from my top three Team Fortress 2 classes by play time.</p>
        <p>The Soldier_engie-demo → SolEngDem → SED</p>
        <p><i>Really</i> long ago it was sometimes shortened to TSED.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Significance of 4906</h3>
        <p>The "4906" part partially came from a YouTube channel called 4096 that made use of After Effects to make transitions that looked really good.</p>
        <p>But it's really just 2¹² with the middle digits in Base 10 swapped. You may see a lowercase h appended in some places, as in the one hexadecimal notation.</p>
